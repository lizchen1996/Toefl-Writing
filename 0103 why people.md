#### Graph 1

##### After graduating from high school many young people have the option to directly enter the work force. 
##### (Directly entering the work force is possible to students who have graduated from high school )

##### Most students who have the opportunity, however, decide to go to college before finding jobs. They attend college to obtain more choices,higher salaries, and more opportunities for advancement in an increasingly competitive job market.

##### Before attending college, students have a limited opportunity to specialize. 
##### (Attending colldge allows students have a bigger range to specialize than getting job after high school )

##### After obtaining a specific college degree . a job applicant can be competitive for previously unavailable jobs. 
##### (With a specific colldge degree and specialized training in colldge ,a job applicant can be competitive for previously unavailable jobs.)

##### For instance, applicants with Computer Science degrees would not only be qualified for jobs in high-tech companies, they would also be well prepared for any job with computerskills as a prerequisite. With a larger range of potential jobs to choose from, degree holders are more likely to find a jobthat suits their particular needs and interests.
##### 这句话的倒装要注意一下(For instance , not only high-tech companies want to hire applicants with Computer Science degrees ,but companies which view computer skills as a prerequisite will also want to hire people who have Computer Science degree. You see , The higher degree you have , the larger range of potential jobs you can choose .)

##### Additionally, employers are willing to pay a premium for highly qualified applicants. 
##### (What's more , employers  are  willing to pay additional allowance for applicants have highly qualified)
##### For example, many companies desire employees who are competent in more than one language and offer higher salaries to attract them. Even if a job
applicant without a college degree has high standardized test scores, employers may still place a higher value on an
applicant with similar test scores who also possesses credentials from a well-known university. Because of the extent to
which a college degree is accepted by employers as proof of competence in a given field, college graduates are not only
more likely to receive more job offers, they can also command higher salaries than applicants who lack college diplomas.
##### （For example , many companies need employees who are competent in more than one Computer Language , and these companies will
offer a higher salaries to attract them .）

Finally, in addition to offering more choices and higher salaries, a college degree offers access to jobs with a clear path
towards professional advancement. A B.S. in biology, for example, could allow a student to find a job in a lab after
graduation, a first step on the road towards a career in scientific research. The same major could also be used to apply to
medical school, and a career as a doctor. Both of these avenues would be unavailable without taking the first step of an
undergraduate degree in biology.
